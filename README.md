## Intro 

As it says in the description, this is a little something I whipped up after watching [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=094y1Z2wpJg) Varitasium video. I thought it was interesting and obviously had no desire to calculate it by hand. So I made a program to do it for me exercising my (at the time) newly acquired C skills. Since then I've learned a lot more, branched into C++, and wanted to expand the usability of the program to handle user input rather than having to be recompiled every time a user wanted to run some new numbers. So this is the ongoing result. I want to try to do a little more for error handling (I know neither C nor C++ likes it when users enter chars when expecting ints/floats) but that'll come later down the road when I feel like adding it :^)

## User Guide

It's really quite shrimple. The program will request a seed for the calculations then run it through the calculations. If the conjecture is true for the seed, it will tell you so! Then it'll ask you if you'd like to do it again with a new seed.
